# Hexchess Roadmap

* Description:
  For v0.1.0, a minimal human vs human, non-networked implementation of GliÅ„ski's chess (herein referred to as Glinski chess) on Linux, in C++, using Qt.

---

## Requirements
* Minimal requirements:
    * Functional
      * Determination and highlighting of legal moves, of end of game due to insufficient resources
    * Opponents: Human vs. Human
    * Save Game & Load Game (modified PGN format)
  * Non-functional
    * TBD
  * Methodology
    * Testing

## Minimal Deliverables
* Ubuntu package implementing Glinski chess as desktop app, implemented in C++ & Qt.
* Documentation (in-game documentation for users; HTML documentation for developers)

##  Optional features (nice-to-have)
  * Alternate pawn configurations for Glinski.
  * Board configuration
    * Support of boards with flat-sided hexagons
  * Chess clocks
  * Computer strategy: Alpha-beta pruning, Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), etc.
  * Engine:
    * Time-limited search for next move
  * Importing:
    * PGN game format
    * JSON format exported by Jocly
  * Opponents: Human vs Computer, Computer vs Computer (with randomness to prevent the same game being played every time)
  * Methodology
    * Docker
    * Github Actions (e.g., Docker build & run tests)
  * Localization, using Qt's mechanism
  * Undo, using QtUndo

## Out of scope
  * Boards with other shapes
  * Computer move determination features
  * Chess engine rating: Targetting any particular chess engine strength
  * Chess puzzles
  * Databases: Opening book/database, or endgame tablebase
  * Play over network
  * UCI support (unless Fairy-Stockfish is adopted as a back-end engine)
  * Variants of hexagonal chess other than Glinski.

---

## Architecture
* Compatibility:
  * Extend chess standards (AN, FEN, PGN, UCI) as needed, with small changes.
  * Use Qt, which supports multiple platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
  * Adhere generally to python-chess's API, as it is popular and well-designed.
* Configurability:
  * Clock settings
  * Colors
    * Settings for B&W, Standard colors, high contrast, etc.
  * Icon set choice
* Extensibility
  * Avoid premature optimization: The path to support of multiple variants doesn't need to be determined before implementation of a second variant begins. Different variants can have different board shape or orientation, different movement of the Pieces, etc. Some options for extensibility:
    * A class enum (Variant) designating the variant, and switch() statements to modify behavior.
    * Dynamic polymorphism
    * Encapsulation (e.g., in small behavioral class)
    * Feature/rule flags
    * Static polymorphism
    * Use of std::variant
  * Upon adding support for a second variant, add a HOWTO document recommending how to add support for other variants.
* Localizability
  * Qt localization
* Security
  * Not addressed

## Design
* TODO: Evaluate suitability of extending Fairy-Stockfish (https://github.com/ianfab/Fairy-Stockfish, by Fabian Fichter) as a back-end for heagonal chess
  * Can F-S model hexchess board (via bitmask)?
  * Can F-S model hexchess moves?
  * Can F-S model hexchess Pawn promotion (uneven)?
  * Licensing implications of using Fairy-Stockfish?
  * Extension to Fairy-Stockfish
  * Inter-component communication: CECP vs UCI:
    * CECP = Chess Engine Communication Protocol
    * UCI = Universal Chess Interface
    * Create Fairy-Stockfish variant configuration for Glinski chess
    * Notation:
      * Extension to FEN (H-FEN, based on X-FEN, FFEN)
      * Extension to PGN (customize via PGN headers)
  * Game Save/Load
  * Coordinate systems
    * Glinski (used by Wikipedia)
    * Ludii
    * Index
    * How does this vary with flat-sided hexagons?
  * iostream output for logging, indlucing to_string(), to_unicode()
* Documentation of rules
  * Explanation of rules
  * Illustration of legal moves for each piece
  * Image of initial board position
  * Glossary: orthogonal = edge-crossing, diagonal = vertex-crossing

## Implementation Timeline:
* TODO: List rought outline of tasks for **August, 2021**, and re-calibrate during implementation.
* Task: Planning; Create Qt Hello world app.
* Task: Design UI; Create wiring of GUI classes with Qt Designer.
* Task: Rendering of Board & Pieces
* Task: Create Move bitboard logic; Logic for determination of {pseudo-,}legal moves
* Task: Create stubs of core classes, with high-level API
* Task: Printing of board (ASCII, Unicode, FEN)
* Task: Board configuration via FEN

## Possible future work (contributions welcome)
* Possible future work
  * Additional hexchess variants:
    * Variants with flat-top hexagon boards:
      * McCooey chess, Shafran chess, and Mini Hexchess
      * Starchess (with a piece-placing setup phase)
    * Variants with flat-side hexagon boards:
      * Brusky Chess and De Vasa Chess
      * Wellisch Chess (3-player variant, with novel Pawn promotion rule)
  * Different bitboard algorithms
    * Faster bitboard implementation, possibly at the cost of increased memory use
    * Allow user to chose speed vs memory trade-offs
  * Create databases:
    * Database of games (either historic, or generated by computer-play)
    * Database of openings
    * Database of game endings ("syzygy tablebase")
